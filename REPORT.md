   <h2 class="gradient-text">INTRODUCTION</h2>
The Internet has rapidly evolved from being merely an information sharing platform to being a social networking platform used by individuals to share content, opinions, and information. Social networking is a global phenomenon that has revolutionized how people interact with each other. It affects nearly every aspect of our life: education, communication, employment, politics, healthcare, social relationships, and personal productivity. A social networking service (SNS) is an Internet-based platform used in building and developing social relations among people. It provides means by which users can interact online with people of similar interests, whether it be for romantic or social purpose. It allows users to share emails, instant messaging, online comments, wikis, digital photos
and videos, and post blog entries. It also offers people with disabilities a chance to make their thoughts and opinions known in a virtual environment.
Social networks serve dual roles as both the suppliers and the consumers of content. They provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile. A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile, post blogs, comment on postings, compile and share list of contacts. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their
profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.
