**Title of the Project:** __Social Networking__
 
It's the way the 21st century communicates now. Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups, like small rural communities or a neighbourhood subdivision. Although social networking is possible in person, especially in the workplace, universities, and high schools, it is most popular online. This is because unlike most high schools, colleges, or workplaces, the internet is filled with millions of individuals who are looking to meet other people. Social network is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected information/knowledge entities. The nodes in the network are the people and groups while the links show relationships or flows between the nodes. Social network provides both a visual and a mathematical analysis of human relationships
